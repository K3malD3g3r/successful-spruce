    content: "## What is UNI?\n\nUNI is the governance token for\_[Uniswap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/uniswap). UNI was introduced on 16th September 2020 through a retrospective airdrop to users who have interacted with the protocol either by swapping tokens or by providing liquidity.\n\nThe UNI token allows token holders to participate in the governance of the protocol. Key decisions such as usage of the treasury or future upgrades can be decided through a governance vote.\n\n## What is Uniswap?\n\nUniswap is a\_[decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/dex)\_that makes it easy for users to swap an ERC-20 token for another ERC-20 token without the need of a centralized intermediary. With a DEX, traders do not have to deposit their tokens on an exchange and be exposed to the security risks of a centralized exchange.\_\n\nUsers just need an\_[Ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum)\_wallet like\_[Metamask](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask)\_and they can immediately start swapping tokens. Users can\_then swap tokens directly without the need of an orderbook. This works using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where Liquidity Providers (LP) deposit tokens into the smart contract and this liquidity then provides a price quote to traders without relying on any professional market makers. Liquidity Providers are compensated with a 0.3% trading fee for providing liquidity on the protocol.\n\n![](https://assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/1611/content_uniswap-v3.png)\n\n## When was Uniswap founded?\n\nThe protocol was founded by Hayden Adams in 2018. Hayden was mainly inspired by the technology that was first described by Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.\n\n## What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?\n\nAn\_AMM uses a pricing algorithm to price assets. Uniswap uses the “x\\*y = k” formula to price its assets. Within the formula, x represents the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, y is the amount of the other asset and k is a fixed constant. In Uniswap, the value of both assets constantly remains at a ratio of 50:50.\n\nUniswap popularized the AMM model and other crypto protocols started utilizing the AMM due to its innovative and decentralized features. However, one of the biggest setbacks for the AMM model is impermanent loss.\n\nImpermanent loss is the opportunity cost of contributing two crypto assets into a liquidity pool instead of holding the two crypto assets separately outside the liquidity pool. Impermanent loss occurs when the price of one token rises or falls relative to the other. The larger the change, the larger the impermanent loss will be.\n"
