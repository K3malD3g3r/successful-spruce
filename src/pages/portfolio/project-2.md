    content: "## What is Basic Attention Token?\n\nA very common question when it comes to Basic Attention Token (BAT) is: “Why would Brave Browser need a token (BAT) for this?”. And the answer lies within Brave’s unusual, yet respectful approach to digital advertising. Brave’s advertisements are privacy centric (does not track the user), and are opt-in only (you only see it if you choose to).\_\n\nAnd that’s where the Basic Attention Token (BAT) comes into play. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, and embedded into the\_[Brave browser](https://brave.com/coi600)\_- it is an incentive token built into the browser to reward all players in the ecosystem - the user, advertiser and publisher.\n\n## Who created Basic Attention Token?\n\nBasic Attention Token (BAT) is a cryptocurrency issued by Brave Inc. for their Brave Web Browser.\n\nBrave Web Browser was first founded in 2015 by web pioneer Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation) and CTO Brian Bondy. Following that, Brave browser launched in 2016 with its key feature of ad and tracker blocking.\n\nThe Basic Attention Token was co-created by Eich and Bondy. The utility token was integrated into the browser and launched officially on May 31, 2017; it managed to raise\_[$35 million](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/brave-ico-35-million-30-seconds-brendan-eich/).\n\n## Why is Brave Browser interesting?\n\nBrave browser’s value proposition is its privacy-centric advertisements which does not track users, and that they are only opt-in. As users browse the web and opt into advertisements on Brave, they are rewarded with BAT for their attention. Publishers also receive a share of the BAT if they are able to retain quality users, while advertisers get better returns on their advertising funds by being able to reach quality audiences who are willing to pay attention to ads.\n\nUsers who have BAT can also choose to automatically contribute their BAT tokens to publishers based on their attention spent on the website or to manually tip them. Some known publishers who have signed up with Brave include The Washington Post, Vice, The Guardian, and more.\_\n"
