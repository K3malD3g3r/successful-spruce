    content: "## What is The Graph?\n\nIt is an indexing protocol and a global API aimed at organizing blockchain data, while making it easily accessible via GraphQL. Developers can use\_[Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/)\_to search, find, and publish all the public data they need to build decentralized applications. This\_makes it possible for developers\_build serverless dApps that run entirely on public infrastructures.\n\n## What is the GRT token?\n\nGRT coin is the\_native token of the network thatâ€™s used to coordinate work. Node operators (called Indexers) can\_stake and earn GRT for processing queries. Anyone can delegate their tokens\_to indexers to secure the network and earn rewards. Curators organize data on The Graph by signaling GRT on useful APIs, called subgraphs. Indexers, Delegators, and Curators work together to organize the data for the crypto economy and maintain a useful global API for DeFi and Web3.\n\n## Who are the founders?\n\nIt was founded by Yaniv Tal (Project Lead), Jannis Pohlman (Tech Lead), and Brandom Ramirez (Research Lead)\n\n## Who are the investors?\n\nThey closed a $5 million private token sale funded by Coinbase Ventures, Framework Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and more; while also did\_a $2.5 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital. A public sale round of $12 million was also concluded few months before the launch of mainnet.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/1188/content_the-graph-protocol-how-it-works.png)\n\n## How does the protocol\_work?\n\nDevelopers can define a subgraph which specifies\_how blockchain data are structured to be consumed by app and dapp developers. App and dapp developers can\_query the\_network using subgraph schemas with\_GraphQL which are paid in\_GRT tokens.\n\nThese data are served by indexers who act\_as nodes,\_incentivized with GRT tokens to ensure that the API is always available in a decentralized manner and data are served correctly.\n\nAs there can be many subgraphs out there, curators are tasked to find the subgraphs that are most useful to developers. Curators are also incentivized with GRT tokens to find the best subgraph that others would find useful.\n\n## Who are its users?\n\nDevelopers are able to obtain most of the essential\_[Ethereum](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum)\_data through The Graph which includes data for\_[Uniswap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap),\_[Balancer](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/balancer),\_[Curve](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/curve-dao-token),\_[Aave](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave), Moloch DAO,\_[Compound](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound), and more.\n\nApps and dapps that are using The Graph includes CoinGecko, Uniswap Info, Decentraland, Synthetix, Aragon, and more.\n\nThe service have also recently expanded to offer data from other blockchains such as\_[Binance Smart Chain](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/binance-smart-chain), Bitcoin, Cosmos,\_[Avalanche](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/avalanche-ecosystem), Flow,\_[Polygon POS](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/polygon-ecosystem), Arbitrum, Celo, and more.\n"
